Welcome to the PCCW Demo application!

This is a Spring Boot microservice with a Thymleaf UI for adding and editing users. One entry point for the UI is 'http://localhost:8080/api/user/all'.

The application is dockerized.  A single bash script can be run to instantiate the app image. Simply execute the file in the source directory: 'bash build_and_run.sh'.

All REST API Documentation can be viewed at 'http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html' once the app is running.

Please reach out for any additional clarity.

Thank you.
